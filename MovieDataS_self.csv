The Shawshank Redemption,1,100,"The Shawshank Redemption holds the Number 1 spot in the Top-250 English Movies listed by IMBd with 9.3 rating. It is one among the best movies ever made in World Cinema and applauded by many film critics. This film was directed by Frank Darabont who adopted the storyline from Stephen King's Novel - 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'

Tim Robbins played his career best lead performance as Andy Dufresne along with Morgan Freeman who played the role of 'Red',  an influential prisoner, who can bring in any stuff inside the jail. Morgan also narrates the story from his perspective with his impeccable voice over throughout the film. He basically narrates the life journey of the lead character - Andy Dufresne. 

The movie begin with a murder mystery which makes the innocent banker Andy Dufresne to go life prisonment in Shawshank prison against the charges for murdering his wife and her lover. Initially, as a viewer audience may expect a murder mystery to be solved but surprisingly the story unfolds the life of the prisoners and journey of thier friendship, trust, affection and emotional tie backs with other prisoners

I never watched Tim Robbins films and this was my first watch of this ace actor. Undoubtedly, he had given his career best performance in this film but surprisingly, he did not get any recognition from Oscars for his best acting performance. During the initial phase of development many leading actors including Tom Cruise were recommended to play the lead role but nothing materialised and finally it was played by Tim Robbins who delivered a flawless world-class performance

The director perfectly casts the lead  and supporting roles. The film comprises of many bone chilling moments which are well crafted with some impeccable writting. Though it was adopted from the novel all cinematic treatments were perfectly balanced to creat this world-class masterpiece.I strongly recommend this film for all the movie buffs who appreciate world Cinema. Also, people who love happy ending flicks with a strong message should definately watch this film. It is available in prime and don't forget to use earphones  to experience the top notch and heart melting background score.

The best thing about this movie is, we experience it with the narration in the background voiceover by Morgan Freeman. It actually helps to bring in the emotional connect with the audience along with some great messages about life, hope, trust and positive attitude. If we look at from technical aspects, we can certainly experience the  great work of lighting and camera with an amazing twisted climax scene.

The unexpected twist and turns from the very beginning till the end with some stunning lifetime best performances, flawless writing and brilliant Direction, makes ""The Shawshank Redemption"" a must watch flick.",10
The Shawshank Redemption,1,101,"However delightful as it is The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. 
It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches it's only a very safe buddy story A damn good one but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for Friendship Huh neat At the end of the day Shawshank is a good film but far from a perfect one. I'm not interested in responding to its Top 250 placement with my review as countless others have done but the fact that it has been voted into the number one slot is a reflection of how universal its appeal is it's about as likable and massmarketed as possible There's nothing here to really offend or provoke and the film doesn't take enough changes to potentially polarize audiences  it plays it safe and in my opinion a bit too safe. I can't say much more than I was incredibly underwhelmed by this film       .
Perhaps it was that I had been told what a great film it was by all and sundry but I found it utterly average I am afraid I just didn't get what was so fantastic about the movie Every other second i was hearing violins about how this poor guy got landed in jail for a murder he didn't commit. It's stereotypical and you guys who voted 10 bought it hook, line and sinker. 
But what about the great twist ok the twist was good but come on like i said before was it THAT great Ask yourselves honestly, was that better than The Sixth Sense's or The Usual Suspects Also how come foreign films which are far superior to this get no credit Watch Le Samurai or La Haine or Todo Sobre Mi Madre. Far more superior
.Don't get me wrong it was an entertaining film but not the masterpiece I was lead to believe it was  SorryThe film's message of hope and redemption is way too heavy-handed, the outcome being a movie that is very simple and easy to digest but not really very interesting beyond its surface. 
On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.It speaks volumes that so many people who have gone through depression often reference this as one of the aids they used for comfort  it's a movie that pats people on the back and gives them hope and inspiration But moving on and looking past that it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves Sure it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story On top of that  it never falls prey to predictable sappiness probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well sewn together by a feel good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film That common misunderstanding behind, a well made film Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies I'm sure the same can be said for him

Though I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made it was still a very good very well made very entertaining and almost heartbreaking

This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie not because its a great one",10

The Dark Night,2,106,"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created.",10
The Dark Night,2,107,"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!",10
The Dark Night,2,108,"It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist. Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs.",10
The Dark Night,2,109,"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.",10
The Dark Night,2,110,"This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!",10
The Dark Night,2,111,"It's hard to find what is wrong with a movie that seems so well crafted and put together. Well let's start by saying that the Dark Knight is very boring and messy.

The plot is incoherent, with too many undeveloped subplots. The movie tries to be realistic but logic has no place anywhere. It tries to be dramatic but the drama is manufactured, out of place, and doesn't build up from anything. Lots of poor philosophical monologues going nowhere.

The characters have nothing, nothing interesting about them. They're like puppets used to create some sort of politicised view of the world where everyone is miserable with no sense of humor, taking no pleasure from their actions whatever they are. And creating this dull vision of the world hidden behind a comic superhero, is what this movie is all about. All the rest comes as a consequence of this. Anything that happens has little or no effect. Batman is just as hollow as every one else. You could swap him with some other character and nothing would change.

Action is just average. Random things happening out of nowhere, and no explanations is given on how they managed to do that. Some great effects here and there don't add much to the movie. I like violent movies but the violence in the DK is pretty much senseless as well as censored. Definitely not for young kids.

The movie is not dark, is hollow. If you want a good dark movie then go to see the awesome 'The Crow'. You want to see a good batman movie then watch the Tim Burton's version.

Flat with no substance, humor or soul, the Dark Knight doesn't leave you with any emotions whatsoever, no hope and not even hopelessness. Only a lame sense of depression.",7
The Dark Night,2,112,"I just rented this from Netflix and forced myself to watch it till the end. What a dreadful, boring yet expensive movie. It was so dimly lit, they could have had any of the thousands of out-of-work actors in Southern California in it with no perceptible difference. I guess a couple more explosions would have helped (not really). I only watched it cause of Heath Ledger's excellent performance in Brokeback Mountain. Boy, was I disappointed. I didn't care about anyone while watching except for myself who was waiting for it to end. At times the dialog was difficult to understand with the volume way up but the loud soundtrack made every sound effect rattle the furniture.

I just don't get what passes for great entertainment nowadays. I had to watch some old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons afterward as an intelligent antidote to this cartoonish movie that tries for so much significance, an odd combination. It's like looking for significance and the meaning of life in an infomercial. Don't bother.",7
The Dark Night,2,113,"Another example of an over-hyped movie, but now in extreme. To say this piece of junk should be regarded as the best movie of 2008 is ridiculous. Basicaly it is just another movie about a man in a bat-suit who duels for more than 2 hours with another badman with a painted smile, and in the process some quasi profound remarks are exchanged. No humor in sight to make the movie better digestible.

Big budget, good actors and some clever make-up artists are no guarantee for a good movie. In this case it resulted in a very boring one.

As for the so-called performance of the year by Ledger; he is (was) a very good actor but this one-dimensional role is far from being special, but I guess the Oscar will be his, Nil nisi bonum.

Why this movie should be on par with, or far better than true masterpieces like the Godfather 1&2 and Vertigo is beyond belief.",5
The Dark Night,2,114,I gave this film a one just to pull down the overall score of the film - it doesn't deserve the 10th place on top 250 list. There is no way that this film deserves ten points!,3
The Dark Night,2,119,Heath Ledger was great in his role as a Joker - no doubt about that. His early departure from the land of the living makes his role stand out in many peoples minds and give a extra glitter to whole movie. Without Joker this film would have much less ten point votes.,2
The Dark Night,2,124,Story really was bloated with too many characters - most of them just showing their face in the movie without any significance to the main storyline. Scarecrow and batman-boys (or what they were called) were totally unnecessary bypassers in the first half of the movie. Story was all over the place and it didn't have the consistency or the red line that it could follow. Many scenes were just boring and ridiculous. This film really didn't give nothing good to the whole Batman saga.,1
The Shawshank Redemption,1,107,"I finally decided to see this film after reading good reviews and noting that this film ranks in IMDB's top ten list (currently #2). At the very least I disovered where all the noble people are: they're in prison!

The film is decent, but it certainly isn't what I would call great or extraordinary. There are good performances by Robbins and Freeman, but the pace of the movie is very slow and the cinematography is unremarkable. Characters are largely stereotypes, the story is somewhat formulaic (and sometimes ludicrous), and the noble prisoners vs wicked guards dichotomy is simplistic and unrealistic. I was also particularly annoyed at the narration, which always seemed to explain more than it needed to. As for the ending, I guess I was not as suprised as others since I did read the Stephen King novella many years ago. Still, given that the story takes place in a prison, you don't need to be a genius to guess part of it.

This movie reminds me of Dead Poets Society in terms of its tone and theme of uplifting the human spirit against a backdrop of despair. If that's your thing, you'll love the movie. It's not really my thing.",1
The Shawshank Redemption,1,108,"he Shawshank Redemption is with out a doubt one of the most over rated films of the 90s. There have been many intriguing prison movies over the years, Shawshank is not one of them. Instead it's sentimental slop served to uplift the souls of the American people. There is never any sense in the film that Tim Robbin's character is in true danger. If the film wanted to show the true horror of prison maybe it should of been far more darker, instead of inspiration. Morgan Freeman is wasted as usual, in the role of wisdom spouting inmate. Freeman's character is mainly there to look wise and bring inspiration to us all, but he is never treated as a typical person. Tim Robbins is good, but his character is all good, while the prison warden is sure evil. Everything is black and white. Shawshank has potential to be great, but director Frank Darabant's obsession with being Frank Capra ruins the film at every turn.",3
The Shawshank Redemption,1,109,"Oh come on 2nd best movie ever, I don't think so. It's unrealistic and overly sentimental, the people who voted so high can't have seen many films. By all means watch it, but Papillion for example, is far superior, who can forget Steve McQueen's red rimmed eyes and pasty face as he catches bugs, and crushes centipedes into his watery broth to get nourishment in that incredible portrayal of hardship and determination. I wouldn't put Papillion as the 2nd best film of all time, but it has to be the best Prison drama. Watch Shawshank and you'll enjoy it as a lightweight entertaining feel good movie, but there are so many classic films better than this.",4
The Shawshank Redemption,1,123,"This movie is absurdly overrated by people who think soppy affirmative moviemaking accompanied by a lush score is synonymous with aesthetic brilliance.

The direction is nothing to write home about, the cinematography is, frankly, standard. The script has Steven King written all over it - a melodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors. (A good example: the moment when the scriptwriter decided that the prisoner's interest in geology had to be spelled out for the dumber members of the audience ""It's all about TIME and PRESSURE..."" just in case anyone managed to miss the connection). Morgan Freeman is, as usual, superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man who goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand. While the film's sympathetic liberal political stance can be commended, it's certainly not a great work of art.",1
The Shawshank Redemption,1,126,"Satisfying, good movie, but the only great part of this movie is the magnificent performance by Morgan Freeman. An apparently inspired Tim Robbins rises above his very mediocre talent and delivers an adequate performance. Ham-handed attempts at profundity in every scene get tiring as is the use of every prison movie device, character, and cliche in the history of hollywood.",2
Kuch Kuch Hota hai,3,103,"I saw this film randomly the other day while at a friend's house. She comes from Indian decent and had always nagged me to watch Indian films with her but I always declined. Being a general film fanatic, I agreed to watch this film, not expecting much. But as soon as I got into the story (and got over the horrible and sometimes non-visible subtitles) I was completely hooked! Whether it was the directing or the wonderful screen presence of the actors, somethng about this film had the ability to capture the emotions of the viewer. I can say that having been used to watching generally American films, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is a romance that stands out from the typical Hollywood love story -- paying attention to detail and character development in a way in which I've rarely seen before. Although I was quite new to Indian ""musical numbers"" in which they incorporate within their films and even found the performances in them a little bit on the cheesy side, I throroughly enjoyed some of the songs as well. Great melodies, especially the title song -- which added to the emotional impact of the movie itself. I wll definitely be looking out for more Indian films in the future.",10
Kuch Kuch Hota hai,3,123,"Karan Johar's directorial debut Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is one of those films you can always watch and enjoy with your family and friends. In spite of being a bit of a fairy tale, it works very well within its limitations. It is one of those beautiful Hindi romantic comedies that actually form the unique cultural and artistic style of Bollywood's most famous mainstream flicks. This is an enjoyable and charming picture which can make you laugh, cry, at times even cringe with annoyance, but then it will keep you consistently entertained.

The film introduces Johar's famous statement that the first step towards love is friendship and does it in a slightly cheesy yet rather convincing way. The film is a poignant story of two friends, a guy and a girl, who understand they actually love each other perhaps too late. And that's how it goes on. It flows well, with wonderfully composed songs, nicely written characters, several clichés here and there, many comic sequences, some melodramatic ones as well, but more importantly, a lot of Bollywood-style colour and fun.

Shahrukh Khan and Kajol work with electrifying chemistry. Their scenes together are pure magic. Both give crafted performances. Kajol is more impressive as the cool tomboy who transforms into a womanly, attractive and sensitive Anjali. She displays the pain, joy, happiness and confusion that her character goes through with great conviction. Shahrukh is fantastic as the young, cool guy, friend and boyfriend and later on as a loving and caring father who has lost his wife and suffers her loss.

Rani Mukherjee is beautiful and vibrant and makes for a very effective intelligent and dreamy girl. This is not an accomplished but very sincere performance which deserves full praise. Salman Khan is very good and surprisingly enough, manages to impress even in a brief, seemingly insignificant appearance. It may be because his character makes a great impact on the film's story and on the viewer.

I really liked the film's music, the title song being my favourite, and among other songs, the melancholic ""Tujhe Yaad Na Meri Aayee"" is very beautiful. Towards the end, there are some overly melodramatic sequences but they flow well enough to bring the long-awaited ending. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is overall great entertainment and a must-watch for lovers of Hindi cinema and its films. It is compelling, moving and memorable, and is always fun to revisit. I recommend.",10
Kuch Kuch Hota hai,3,109,"I hadn't watched an Indian movie in years because I was unable to relate to the film and the stories were somewhat weak. When I got this movie, I procrastinated a bit; when I finally watched it, I was amazed! I was able to relate to the characters, the story was not as far-fetched as they had been, and the music was awesome. KKHH has a good mix of humor and drama, without being too over-the-top. It got my family and me watching Indian movies again. I recommend this to anyone who wants to be swept away by a good story and great actors.",10

With very good music (the title song is a forever classic!), entertaining dance moves, a nice script, and the most beautiful Jodi ever on screen: SRK and Kajol!

Kuch Kuch Hota hai,3,119,"I have no personal connection to India, and no knowledge of Bollywood cinema. This is the first Bollywood movie I've seen.

My impression is that it is as if the film is made by two separate crews: the ones that make the musical numbers, and the ones that do the ""prose"" in between the singing. The musical numbers are catchy, fun, playful, and just sprawling with talent. I'd gladly see a few of those again. The rest of it...I found it pretty hard to watch, like a very long advertisement for gum or sports clothing. I guess it's supposed to be a kid friendly movie, so there is a lot of not-so-subtle emotions?

I gave this movie a rating of 7. If it was just the singing parts it would be an 8. If it was just the rest, it would have been lower than a 4. But I prefer to judge a movie more by its best parts.",8
Kuch Kuch Hota hai,3,112,"This movie was not a good one.

Like many SRK movies this has just survived on hype.

The title song is absolutely melodious. However the movie was lacking entertainment quotient. Shallow emotions on display. Its made by a SRK fan for SRK fans. There is too much of love in the air, seems like every collegian or high-school student needs to be in love with someone. Its not right to project or promote such wrong things.

But what matters is how the movie did on the box office, and this movie faired well. Another SRK movie, Karan Arjun, which was one of the worst movies ever from Bollywood but it is one of the biggest grosser ever.

KJO needs to do something original and better without SRK.",6
Kuch Kuch Hota hai,3,118,"Rahul...... Anjali..... Rahul...... Anjali....

Oh dear! Time has not been kind to this film.

When I first saw this at the cinema I loved the music and was thoroughly entertained by the whole show. All 3 leads were spectacular and Salman Bhai also put in a good performance.

However 10 years on and the only enjoyable part of the movie is the song which kicks in when Anjali realises she's never gonna get Rahul.

3 Idiots,4,115,"It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.

Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since ""3 Idiots"" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.

As for the plot, it's very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I don't want to spoil a single wonderful moment, so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance, I can almost guarantee you'll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script, wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. See this film.",2
3 Idiots,4,124,"I asked my co-workers to recommend a Bollywood movie. I expected ""Dumb and Dumber"" by the title. It wasn't that at all. It is more of an inspirational comedy with some serious but good messages. A more accurate title would have been ""The Legend of Rancho"".

Odd to me is that they speak in part English, part Hindi through the movie, kinda like some speak ""Spanglish"" here I suppose. I know none of the actors but the acting was good, and there was plenty of humor. The characters were believable. Most movie dancing I find a little silly but I even liked the dancing routines in the bathroom.

I will be asking my co-workers for more recommendations after this one!",10

3 Idiots,4,113,"Awesome film man. Saw this with my family in a theatre. Worth every penny n worth every minute. Never seen such an amazing film from Bollywood. What is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. The last 30 mins were beautifully shot. Very good direction by Hirani. The star cast is good n Aamir khan steals the show. The editing is top notch. U don't feel bore for even a sec. Awesome screenplay. It's hands down the best film in the history of Bollywood.",10
3 Idiots,4,103,"Unlike many other Bollywood movies, 3 Idiots was enjoyable - at some points.

Firstly, the film provides a useful message - do what you love rather than what someone else thinks you should do. It also has a clever and quite unpredictable plot which makes the film certainly watchable.

However, the reason for this film's downfall is due to its comedic aspect. The jokes and comedy to this film is super immature and childish and wouldn't make 99% of adults laugh. I genuinely believe that if this film had little to no comedic aspects, or at least a less childish comedic aspect, and was a serious film it could be comparable to Good Will Hunting.

Had the potential to be a global success but only succeeded domestically.",10
3 Idiots,4,127,"I watched '3 idiots' on the Christmas Day. Being an Aamir Khan fan the expectations were huge. The movie is excellent, absolutely fun filled and hilarious but deviates from its main idea of Education system after the intermission.

The depiction of education system of India is completely true where each and every prof. is interested only in the fact that you have mugged up his lessons on not. Being an IITian myself I can assure you of this. Aamir Khan is awesome, Sharman and Madhavan are also good as usual. Boman Irani rocks again with his stand out performance. Kareena Kapoor is OK considering her not so important role. The stand out scene of this movie is clearly Omi's 'Balatkaar' speech.",8

3 Idiots,4,109,"The script is the biggest problem with this film. It is filled with clichés and unoriginal jokes. The theme and message of the film is spelled out for the audience a million times. It should be more subtle and realistic. The sequence of events is entirely predictable.

Additionally, there is nothing exceptional about any other element of the film in my opinion. There is nothing impressive about the camera work. There is nothing impressive about set design or costume design. There is nothing impressive about the acting or characterization.

It is emotionally manipulative using every trick in the book and there is nothing to enjoy if you do not fall for that. How it is so far up IMDb's top 250 is beyond me.",5
3 Idiots,4,105,"over hyped, unbelievably ridiculous",3
3 Idiots,4,110,"Being an Indian I have seen a lot of Bollywood movies which do not live upto international standards. 3 Idiots is no different. It's a masala movie, which will draw only mainstream and dumb folk. It might be attractive to the viewers outside as such experiences are new to them, however the truth is that this movie doesn't deserve any place in any top lists on IMDb. I'm sure that the people who have given it a 10/10 have never seen any other movie on the top 250 list. It was a major hit in Indian theatres and any rational,logical and a real movie buff can never like this sort of an impractical movie. To be honest, for an Indian movie I'd give it a 6/10 , however on an international scale it would barely get a 5. If you want to watch a good Indian movie, I'd recommend watching Dev.D which I rate as an 8/10; and I feel should be on the top 250 list. Make a wise decision",1
Avengers: Endgame,5,106,"But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...

The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.

To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.

And the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.

To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.

It seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to... Because i just don't give two cents about any of them",10

The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,124,"I liked this film very much. It is much darker than the previous outings, but not as faithful to the source material. The only thing I didn't like so much about the book, was the subplot about Hermione trying to help house elves. It was cute, but interfered too much with the dark overtones of the narratives. The film looks dazzling, especially the ballroom scene. Speaking of that scene, I adored that dress that Hermione was wearing, Emma Watson looked unrecognisable in that scene.Also the music by Patrick Doyle this time was beautiful. I don't think it's as dark as the book, and I wasn't too keen on some of the casting. Roger Lloyd Pack and David Tennant were fine in their roles as the Crouches, but their characters were changed significantly. I did wish they made Crouch's disappearance more mysterious, instead of giving it away, ruining the suspense that was quite compelling up to that scene. I am not too keen on Michael Gambon's Dumbledore, I just don't remember Dumbledore being violent as they made him. As I've said already, I much prefer Richard Harris as the character. I am also on the fence about Mad Eye Moody. Brendan Gleeson is a very talented actor, evident in films like In Bruges and The General. He looked the part, but his voice wasn't exactly what I had in mind for Moody. I have listened to the audio tapes by Stephen Fry, and I imagine Moody's voice as low and gravelly. Although Gleeson mostly succeeded with his role, I personally think he tried too hard. My brother also noted that he didn't like the execution of the three tasks. I didn't like the third task, and the other two were fine. I did think on a positive note that Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort was suitably scary, and with the exception of Dumbledore everyone else was well done. All in all, a flawed but quite engrossing film, that doesn't quite live up to the darkness of the book. 8/10 Bethany Cox",10
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,122,"It's unfortunate that so much of the book needed to be cut for time and the movie is still nearly 2 1/2 hours long. The rule of movie editing is when you must trim for time you remove the sub-plots. A lot of story and character development isn't there.

But what is there is a great visual treat. If the movie leaves you with questions just read the book or get the audio version on CD. It would have taken a minimum of another half hour to flesh the movie out and that simply wasn't going to be done by a studio whose primary target is a younger audience. (Note how no studio wants to release an animated film longer than 90 minutes for this reason.) Perhaps Alphonso Curon would have done a better job of cohesion but there really isn't much more that could have been done in the time and the script would have been essentially the same. This movie begs for an extended Lord of the Rings type DVD, another 30 to 60 minutes to give you what was left out for theatrical release.

See it and spend the bucks to see it on the big screen.",10
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,103,"While Prisoner was a step forward I alway felt like the film adaptation of Goblet was a step back simply due to time. Goblet really should be longer to cover all the stuff going on here. Yes, we have the games but in order to do that right the whole movie has to be about that. There's not enough time to explore all the other stuff going on here, the relationships shifting and adapting, the mystery of what's going on. None of this feels more epitomized than in the relationship of Ron and Harry. Best buddies up until now and yet, suddenly they're fed up with each other. I understand the reasoning of it all but it doesn't feel like the film is allowed to live in that enough to make the reactions feel reasonable or earned.

Goblet of fire is still decent, it just doesn't feel like a step forward for the series. It's entirely necessary but doesn't progress or amp up in a meaningful enough way. Not that it really matters because at this point you're likely 3-4 movies in and you're either going to see this through or you're not. Just know that it gets progressively better from here.",5
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,105,"Mike Newell is forgiven for cutting out so much detail from the book, and JK Rowling is forgiven for writing wonderfully rich books. However, fans of the book cannot help but feel like riding a roller coaster that is so fast there is no time to enjoy the ride. I predict the huge void between book and movie will spur remakes in about 10 to 20 years. Even if the movies must be 5 hours long, Harry Potter fans are willing to sit through them. This movie doesn't get a 10 because it leaves me feeling like something is missing, but it does deserve a 9 for being the best possible portrayal of the book given a 2.5 hour limitation. All said and done, this is the shortest 2.5 hour movie I have ever watched.",5

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,114,"I found this installment of the Potter series hard to follow, and frankly, dull and boring. The ""extra"" characters from other schools dilute the ""feel"" of the film. It departs too far from the magic as it pertains to Harry Potter's life and destiny, and relies too much on special effects.

Also, not enough Snape ;-)

Since the kids are getting older, they have to be given boys and girls to fall for, which turns me right off, as such storylines always slow down films. (I'm a female who HATES chick flicks)... and that is exactly what happens.",3
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,110,"Both of us agreed, the Goblet of Fire was a soulless, mechanical, disappointment. The latest Potter movie has no humor, no wit, and substitutes frenetic action for plot and dialogue. The characters seem made of cardboard, being moved about by the director to advance the plot. There is none of the subtlety, or wit of the first movie. None of the character development and advancing friendship between the main characters of the second movie. As the Potter movies advance, they have steadily deteriorated. These movies now absolutely are not for children under 16 and are largely a waste of time. Special effects do not make the movie any more. We give the Goblet of Fire two thumbs down for sloppy script, lack of intelligence and substitution of mishmash for coherence.",1
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,100,This is a awesome Harry Potter Movie It is really pretty well done with a dark and spooky feel It almost made me wet my pants and I'm 28 years old.

I can't wait for the DVD to find out if there's anything added that was left out of the film. This movie is best on the big screen. The young actors are growing up well. I'm afraid that pretty soon they will be too old for there roles in the film. I know some people probably won't like this film too much and its not for the really young kids but Its a great film and I would not miss it for the world.,10
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,107,"In 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' the gang has returned to Hogwarts for yet another school year. This year is special, for Hogwarts is to host the TriWizard tournament. Contestants from rival schools (Beauxbatons Academy and the Durmstrang Institute) have come to participate. This is a very dangerous competition, so dangerous that only one upperclassman from each school can compete. However, when Harry Potter's name is selected as a fourth contestant, the involvement of the evil Voldemort is suspect.

This is the fourth installment of J.K. Rowling's series of Harry Potter books. I did like this much better than the last film 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban', but I still think the first two were better. On it own merits, there is very little character development if any in this movie. You do not really learn much about the new characters that are introduced. Plus you can see several areas where there holes in the plot. I feel these books are getting just too big to cram into one movie. This book should have been made in to two films. It is two and a half hours long, but the time goes by really fast.

I think the director (Mike Newell) did a better job bring the look and feel of Hogwarts than the director (Alfonso Cuarón) of the last. Be that as it may, I still feel there is too much missing in this film and I did not read the book.",1
Before Sunrise ,7,120,"While traveling by train through Europe, the American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet each other and decide to spend the night together in Austria. On the next morning, Jesse returns to United States of America, and Celine to Paris.

""Before Sunrise"" is one of my favorite romances, indeed one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. It is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and the dialogs are stunning. The direction is amazing, transmitting the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I have just completed my review number 1,000 in IMDb, and I choose ""Before Sunrise"" for this significant number because it is a very special film for me. I cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the Oscar, with such a magnificent screenplay, direction and performances. Yesterday I have probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. My vote is ten",10
Before Sunrise ,7,109,"American tourist Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets French student Celine (Julie Delpy) on the train. He talks her into getting off and walk around in Vienna. They walk the night away.

I really love this movie when it first came out. There was no hint of the following sequels. It's just a great charming first date movie. The leads have great chemistry. They are both charming and lovely. This is a lot of first-date talk. It doesn't get tie down by artificial plot elements. There is nothing to drive the plot. There is no Holy Grail. There is no quest. There is no destination. There are just two people talking and trying to connect. It stops and starts. They meet two oddly funny Germans who invite them to their play. In a more conventional movie, they would actually go to this play. They forget to go and that's kind of the point. Their journey meanders without much direction. There are also great scenes of long continuous takes. Director Linklater just let the actors go on forever on the streetcar. The whole movie feels refreshing.",10
Before Sunrise ,7,130,"""Before Sunrise"" is a wonderful love story and has to be among my Top 5 favorite movies ever. Dialog and acting are great. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna, introduced in the movie does not exist (you won't find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and it isn't possible to get to all the places in only one night, either (especially if you're a stranger and it's your first night in Vienna). But that's not the point. The relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Although, nothing ever really happens, the movie never gets boring. The ending is genuinely sad without being ""Titanic"" or something. Even if you don't like love stories you should watch this film! I'm a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.",8
Before Sunrise ,7,100,"Before Sunrise (1995)' essentially has no plot and, though that's the point as the intention is to be a romance with all the extraneous 'Hollywood' elements removed, this leads to an experience that feels loose, aimless and meandering. It's experimental and laid-back by design but isn't the most gripping of narrative pieces because of it. It certainly feels less a character-study of its two leads and more a vehicle for Linklater, Krizan, Delpy and Hawke (the latter two of whom contributed heavily to the script uncredited) to express some of their most unique of ideas. These come constantly, seeming like stories they've told to friends or theories they have about life, love and religion, and, while they can be interesting (genuinely thought-provoking in cases), they don't really develop the characters and seem sort of out of place within the story. It's difficult to explain why most of that stuff doesn't seem to work, but it just doesn't feel fully genuine in most cases. It doesn't feel like it comes from the characters or express their budding romance, though this sort of talk certainly forms the basis for most relationships. Still, it isn't all unsuccessful. There is certainly some charm to the picture, once it picks up steam. In the end, the experiment seems to have worked. It was creatively refreshing for all involved and evokes memories of wandering around a holiday destination talking about nothing for hours. There's even some impressive long takes and the 'unscripted' feel is admirable considering it was all scripted down to the letter. This all leads to a sort of inane, carefree and somewhat nostalgic - if limited - enjoyment of a hundred-minute conversation told with cinematic language. 6/10.",4
Before Sunrise ,7,123,"Who'd have thunk back then, that this would spawn a trilogy? My guess is nobody. But the first movie was strong enough to have followers and believers in it. Apart from the setting and the two magnificent actors, we get treated to some wonderful dialog. Some great scenery as well and the one subject that rules most of our lives -> Love.

Represented not only by a male and female, but also two different cultures. But it still never feels like this is a cliché or tries to get some cheap shots in to make you laugh. This feels genuine and as viewers we can and should appreciate that. So while this is not necessary watching, you should take a look at this before ... watching the sequels!",6
Before Sunrise ,7,129,"I have always come across scenes from this movie, but i never got the chance to watch it. Now, after i watched it, i really think it was a waste of time.

Before Sunrise ,7,106,"Annoying frat boy hits on French girl. For 12 hours. But the worst part is that the French girl goes along with it. For 12 hours. And we are forced to go along with it. For 2 hours. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to smack someone.

Perhaps it wouldn't have been so bad if there had been some sort of chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. I mean, after all, even annoying frat boys can fall in love. But no. The two are so incompatibly different that, despite what the script says, none of the flirtations are believable. I imagine the minute the director yelled ""cut"", Julie would spin around and head straight for her trailer. Ethan would go soak his head. The problem is that the director never yells ""cut"". Instead we are subjected to watching the awkward, contrived and stiff ramblings of these two people who have nothing in common except for the script.

I saw what the director was trying to do. He was trying to capture the poetry of life through long, continuous shots and mundane dialogue. He was trying to show us how wonderful the simplicity of everyday life can be. But there is nothing artistic or poetic about the shots, the dialogue or the emotion on screen. The whole thing feels like an awkward date you just cant wait to ditch.

""Before Sunrise"" is like ""When Harry Met Sally"", except without the humour, the charm, the witty style, the plot or the music. In essence, there is no reason to watch this movie. If you do watch this movie, make sure you're not sitting near anyone or you might get smacked.

Then, when I got to my destination, I went to the theater with some girls in Spain, and it was named something else in Spanish so I had no idea I was going to watch it again until I was already there.

The story is, some girl meets some guy on a train and then they spend the next hour and a half talking about absolutely nothing. If you like movies where two people sit there and talk the whole time and maybe fall in love, you'll love this. Everyone else should stay far away.

Before Sunrise ,7,104,"Very Natural feeling and wonderfully romantic. If you wonder whether a movie can sustain interest by merely showing two people having conversation, while walking around Vienna, then Before Sunrise might be your answer. I personally found it enjoyable. It is true its main characters spout a lot of youthful pretentiousness, but that is rather the point of the movie, I believe. Whatever else, Linklater can hardly be faulted for attempting something a little off the beaten path, stylistically speaking.",8
Tumbbad,8,109,"Would you believe me if I tell you the budget of this film is just 5 crores (nearly $700k)? Before you let that fact sink in, would you believe me if I also tell you that this is the director's first ever film? Rahi Anil Barve - remember this name. You might need to speak it when someone asks you who your favourite Bollywood director is. This film was made for 6 years. Keep reading, I will tell you why it took so long.

Tumbbad is set in the village of the same name in Maharashtra. The story is set during the colonial period, and also some of it just after the independence. Though the village exists in real, it is nothing like what has been described in the film. According to the film the village has been cursed for writing the name of Hastar, a demon son of a Goddess who gave birth to 160 million gods. Because of the curse it is always raining in Tumbbad. Since the budget of this film was so low, the filming was only done during monsoon season when it was actually raining in the village. That's how low the budget of the film is - they couldn't even afford fake rain so they had to wait for 6 years to complete the filming.

In spite of the low budget, it does not give the feeling of being cheap at all. In fact if I didn't know better, I'd think this is a very expensive film. The actors aren't popular, but I don't see where the problem is over there. How many of us knew the names of all the actors from Baahubali? Still we watched it, right? So I'd think this is also a regional film. The acting is phenomenal. The horror scenes absolutely give me the creeps. It's perfect in every sense. Even the ending is left on an ambiguous note, enough to leave a shrill down anyone's spine. The posters of this film are also very good, and it's a shame to say that the worst one has been used over here. Look up for the other posters on Google Images.

The reason why Tumbbad failed to cross a huge commercial mark is because it wasn't advertised at all. If I hadn't read an answer on Quora that said it should have been sent to the Oscars instead of Gully Boy, I'd have never even known about its existence. There was literally no talk of it. Sure it has a low budget for making the film, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't spend in the marketing at all. It was so awesome, I for one would have definitely seen it if I had heard about it before. Also the only way to watch it now is through Prime, which will show you this film only if you type the correct spelling in the search box. It's a shame that you can't watch this film unless you know specifically what you're looking for.

I really admire the dedication of the director to make this film. He clearly knew this film wasn't going to be earning those big bucks, yet he continued to make it. This is what happens when you have directors who treat their work not as products but rather as works of art. I really aspire to be a filmmaker of that type. This film will be a very big lesson to me. I wish Rahi Anil Barve a very successful and prosperous career in the future.",10

With this movie , indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity . I have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india, in past all they do is cut copy paste. This movie is definitely original. They do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder. The director completely relies on the story to work and it works. The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie. Most of the scene includes rain , the greens and a dark environment which works superbly . Director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods. They don't even try to do that ,it's the story and the environment which worked for them. Most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye's attention towards the character. Actors have pulled there character successfully specially Soham Shah who is also the producer. A thousand year old myth , greed, deep dark corner of a humen's psyche , a monster (within and out too), ajay atul's precise background score , the spellbound scenic value and a world class direction . There is so much more this movie has to offer. The masala movie watcher may not able to appreciate the movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves a sensible class of audience.",10
Tumbbad,8,116,"Tumbbad is a period horror movie starring Soham Shah, Anita Date, Ronjini Chakraborty and Mohammed samad with Jyoti Malshe and Deepak Damle playing supporting roles. The movie is directed by Rahil Anil Barve and Adesh Prasad.

The movie is probably one of the best and beautiful horror movie of Bollywood. The director duo were so dedicated for the perfection of the movie as it took six years to make this movie but were reshot as the director duo was not satisfied with the movie and Soham shah maintained his look for the entire duration of six years.

The acting is great by all the characters but highlights are Soham Shah and Mohammad Samad.

Cinematography is beautiful and so as the virgin location used in major shooting. Majority of the movie is shot in natural light which gives the realistic impact also the entire movie was shot during the monsoon to give realistic cloudy feel. Background music is superb so as the screenplay. The movie doesn't looses it's plot anywhere and keeps you engaged.

This movie is one of the milestones in the history of Indian cinema and a must watch for every true movie lover.",10

Tumbbad,8,124,"Tumbbad is not a common movie. It will leave you gripped to your seat making you think ""what would happen next"". Whole movie is so beautifully shot no wonder it is shot in natural light and the beauty is visible. This movie is a feast for your eyes with cinematic excellence is on full display. You wouldnt even have time to wander off your mind but watch it with eyes wide open. You won't enjoy it on small screen but have to watch in cinema halls. Mind you this movie took 6 years in making can you believe in the perseverance of the people who clung onto movie for 6 years despite harships.",8
Tumbbad,8,126,"I cant believe what i just watched. This is like best storytelling ever i saw in Indian movies and trust me I watched many. I literally lost interest in indian cinemas and i now i cherry pick movies from few directors/writers . My last favorite desi thriller was UGLY and I'm very proud to say WAS. I hope more people start taking interest in movies like this and support the ""artists""(), yes whole film crew team is group of artists who really created something magical. I truly hope that we could get to see more like this. Dont waste time reading anymore reviews and just go watch it.",9
Tumbbad,8,113,"The hundreds of 10/9 reviews honestly make no sense.

Calling this a horror movie is a stretch. It's not horrifying, it's not scary, it's just a long drawn out snooze fest with a dodgy CGI monster and some dreadful zombie type things.

There is no real story. It has a single conceit that's repeated over and over. The mythology is too simple to support the running time which was overly long. Maybe if they had cut half an hour out of it it may have been tighter and better?

The main character is a unpleasant person. You can't root for such a poor excuse for a man. The dialogue is dull.

Ignore the rave reviews. If this is the best thing out of this country I feel sorry for all the people who have to put up with worse than this.

Nearly two hours of my life I'm not getting back, should have listened to my gut and turned it off after 20mins.",5
Tumbbad,8,103,"There are too many reviews here overrating this move. Now, don't get me wrong, the production of this film is very good and the cinematography is really well done for a budget of this calibre...or even if it had cost more. Also I must say that the narrative of the first half of the film choosing when to reveal info to you, is enjoyable. However that's as far as the praise goes with me. Watching the protagonist and the characters around him from the very beginning just leaves you with such distaste. You end up totally disengaging yourself from these characters of the story due to their choices and behaviour. Of course they are meant to be like this, however there is no real contrast to this so that the viewer can find themselves drawn to another character. The characters themselves are very selfish and simplistic, that don't evolve over the script and and just leave you empty. This is the same for the story itself, where it comes across like a children's tale that is filled with adult like horror visuals. This is a shame as the premise behind the story feels like an original story, but it lets you down in what it chooses to do with this film.",5

A Space Odyssey,9,105,"A stand-alone monument in cinema history, Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is an undeniable masterpiece. 2001 not only shattered science fiction genre conventions, but gave cinema a whole new meaning. From the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution, 2001 isn't concerned with entertaining us- but rather to inspire us with awe. I've never seen a person say, ""2001: A Space Odyssey? I don't think I've seen it... oh wait, the one with like, the spaceships and stuff?"", while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll. What viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you ""get it"" or not, nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects- but as Kubrick said, is ""...intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness."" In it of itself, exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment, but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one- that's sheer genius at its highest form.

At its premiere, 2001 polarized critics and audiences alike. Walkouts numbered well over 200, including Rock Hudson who asked, ""Will someone tell me what the hell this is all about?"" The New York Times remarked, ""Somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring."" ""Superb photography major asset to confusing, long-unfolding plot,"" Newsday commented. Renowned critic Pauline Kael even went as far as calling 2001 ""trash masquerading as art"". It's understandable, though. In a time in which excitement revolving around interstellar exploration and extra-terrestrial life was everyday talk, audiences came into 2001 expecting answers. When will we reach the moon? What does the future hold? Are we alone? To their great surprise, 2001 did the paradoxical; leaving more questions to answer than answered questions.

Even though the late 60s marked the height of technological optimism, Kubrick saw ahead, highlighting the potential negatives of technological advancement. Notice the contrast between how apes and humans approach the monolith. The apes approach it with dignity, respect, and mindfulness. The humans approach it with arrogance, grouping astronauts in front of the monolith to take a picture. Since the monolith represents the incomprehensible (man, with his limited senses, cannot comprehend the absence (perfect black) of color or light), Kubrick may be suggesting the manner in which we handle new information is careless and hasty, emphasized in the Clavius base briefing. Scientists discuss how to distribute this exciting news to the public, for ""if the facts were prematurely and suddenly stated without adequate preparation and conditioning"", as stated by Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester), it may cause ""cultural shock and social disorientation"". It's a significant message to the anxious people of 1968 to perceive fresh information precisely and draw conclusions logically.

Yet apes are not much better. They're not willing to share food and water with their fellow apes, and with the discovery of bones as weapons, kill their own race for a puddle of water- possibly foreshadowing our own demise if we continue to advance artificial intelligence. Because like our ancestors, at heart, mankind has been and will always be selfish.

Far before The Terminator (1984) or The Matrix (1999) accentuated the dangers of artificial intelligence, there was 2001. H.A.L 9000, voice played by Douglas Rain, was ingeniously crafted into one of the most terrifying villains in film history. There's something about his calm voice, unpredictability, and especially, his omniscient single red eye that's so frightening. Kubrick utilizes one of his favorite filmmaking devices to compare artificial intelligence with humans: irony. Neither Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) or Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) display much emotion throughout the film, while H.A.L, albeit a machine, exhibits some while pleading for life singing ""Daisy"" (which, by the way, is a heart-wrenching scene) and murdering his crew members. There are clear connotations of humanity's fate when H.A.L attempts to kill Frank, Dave, and the hibernating crew members. Yet H.A.L, contrast to what he may think, is not perfect. If he was incapable of miscalculating even the slightest bit, he wouldn't have gotten himself killed. Kubrick implies that artificial intelligence has not yet reached the level of annihilating the human race, but if we are not careful, they soon will.

This idea coincides with the perplexing final sequence, resembling man reaching the next stage of evolution. After the famous ""Star Gate"" sequence, Dave is enlightened in a room. The setting hints at the Enlightenment Era, exquisitely decorated in 18th century style and embellished with lavish paintings and furniture. Notice how the room is solely lit through the transparent ground, establishing a heavenly environment. The eerie silence is ominous, magnifying the mystical aura that is ever so present in the timelessness of the final scene. As Dave exits his EVA pod, he watches himself age rapidly through one-point perspective. He knocks over a wine glass while eating, suggesting that man, no matter how advanced, will keep making mistakes. As he lays on his deathbed later, he reaches out to the monolith, alluding to Adam reaching out to God in Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. After man is enlightened, he inevitably dies.

A pessimistic ending? No. Man is then transported back to Earth as a ""Space Baby"", an infinitely more advanced race, marking a new age of evolution. A masterful stroke of genius, Kubrick ends hopeful, giving us another chance to improve on our mistakes. Or is it hopeful? Is he implying that civilization is evolving badly? Or is he suggesting that civilization will NEVER evolve? There are multiple interpretations of the ending, and it's a question for you to answer.

There is such a great deal of symmetry in 2001's composition throughout the film, possibly suggesting the equilibrium present in the universe. The painstakingly slow pace also compliments the exactness of its harmony, practically forcing you to admire its artistry. While Andrei Tarkovsky's work would breathe with such organic and poetic beauty, Kubrick's artificial visual fluidity mesmerizes the eye with meticulous precision and thoroughness. Each shot, averaging 13.6 seconds, possesses a sense of purity and perfection that can only be achieved through the medium of cinema.

But of course, it's impossible not to talk about 2001 without mentioning one aspect. The visual effects are so unanimously praised that it's hopeless to even try to describe how groundbreaking and influential they were. Hopeless. I can talk for days about the impeccable zero-gravity effects, clever rotating sets, fastidiously constructed spaceships, the brilliant use of slit-scan photography for the psychedelic Star Gate sequence, or how it pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting, but what's the point? You don't need me to appreciate 2001's immaculate visuals.

Finally, the choice of music is outstanding. Originally, Alex North was appointed to score the film, but Kubrick turned it down in post-production. Critic Roger Ebert explains it perfectly, ""North's (rejected) score, which is available on a recording, is a good job of film composition, but would have been wrong for 2001 because, like all scores, it attempts to underline the action-to give us emotional cues. The classical music chosen by Kubrick exists outside the action. It uplifts. It wants to be sublime; it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals.""

""But why all the slow parts?"" asks the one who fell asleep. Primarily, to establish tone. Unlike the low-budget commercial science fiction movies preceding it, 2001 was meant to be taken seriously. It symbolizes a quest for whether God exists or not, challenges humanity's fate, and questions evolution as a whole. If each shot's average length was two seconds and there was some sappy romantic love subplot mixed in between, the whole film would've been a mess. Space isn't fast-paced like we see in most movies. Space is slow-really, really, slow. The addition of three minutes and seventeen seconds of a black screen in the beginning was also pure genius, a signal for casual moviegoers to get out of the theater now and save your time.

Thankfully, its ingenuity was gradually recognized, and it's now widely regarded as one of the greatest and influential films of all time. It stands at an impressive #6 on the BFI ""Sight and Sound"" Critics' poll in 2012, ties for 2nd in the Director's poll, places 15th on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies, and tops the Online Film Critics Society list of ""greatest science-fiction films of all time"".

2001: A Space Odyssey breaks almost every rule there is in filmmaking. The first half drags, the dialogue is unnatural, the static camera creates no visual interest, there are barely any emotional punches, characters are monotonous, and none of the protagonists, if there even are, have dimensionality, arcs or epiphanies. Nonetheless, it's transcendental and sublime, awe-inspiring and thought-provoking, visually revolutionary, technically impeccable, monumentally imaginative, substantially rich, and way ahead of its time, thriving with unparalleled originality and ambition.

Only a few films will live forever. 2001 is one of them. Happy 50th birthday.",10
A Space Odyssey,9,102,"Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species. For anybody to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as ""boring"" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making. Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.

Thankfully, those that cannot appreciate Kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority. Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic. This is the film that put the science in ""science fiction"", and its depiction of space travel and mankind's future remains unsurpassed to this day. It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up.

2001 is primarily a technical film. The reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes). The film's greatest strength is in the details. Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey. To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - I still can't work out how some of the shots were done. The film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind's technological (and social) development. It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not Kubrick's.

Besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going. Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that's the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it's up to the audience to continue. There's no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel. I know that's what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly.

I'm glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher. Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10.",10
A Space Odyssey,9,112,"Count me as one of the philistines who is too simple-minded to appreciate this so-called masterpiece. Actually, I have a degree in media studies and a great interest in science, science fiction and anything thought-provoking (the technical term is ""need for cognition""). But I am just baffled by this film and why it is so esteemed. It is simply slow, empty and lifeless. When absolutely nothing is happening on screen, am I supposed to feel or think something profound? Even when my professor explicitly explained to me why this film is so great, I still cannot convince myself that it is so.",6
A Space Odyssey,9,114,"I felt the need to review this movie after reading some reviews from other users, simply because I agreed with all. Those who love it, those who hate it, those who enjoyed it, all of them. And the reason is simple: everything they say makes sense to me. I watched the movie for the first time about 10 years ago, and watched it again last night. It still doesn't make perfect sense to me. I mean, the story is absent, the characters don't really get through you, and the ending...who gets that ending?? #SPOILERS# BELOW

The end makes no sense to me... The psychedelic travel, the space child... Maybe I'm just plain stupid, but spending two and a half hours looking at space, slooowww space, and in the end just watch a man in bed, then a baby in a bubble, no explanations, no nothing... Truly, if someone got it and has the hability to explain it to me without calling it ""art"" or whatever, simply explain it to me, I would be very thankful, not kidding. Maybe that way I would be able to enjoy it next time I watch it, maybe ten years from now.

That been said, why would I rate it a 7...? I believe when I watch a movie for the first time, I should put myself at the time, the era, the social paradigm, the movie was released. And this movie is cleary ahead of its time. Note, that I am talking about the visual effects, and the general idea of the movie. This movie clearly marked an era, a filmmaker, visual effects and the idea of what space was like. For that it deserves a high rating, maybe the highest. Not to mention the hype the movie STILL causes. We still can't reach an understanding...is it a masterpiece, is it overrated. The only way to really be able to discuss it and form your own opinion is to watch it, so the movie reaches its goal: to be watched and debated. A blockbuster rarely does this, we just watch them to get some good action scenes, visual effects, whatever, but when a filmmaker creates a movie that creates hype, controversy and most importantly, a vision of the future, he is creating a cult movie...a classic.

To sum up, as I said in the beginning, when i read people calling it a classic, a masterpiece, I have to agree, but I also agree with those who say its overrated and boring...For me both sentences are true.",7
A Space Odyssey,9,124,"Humanity finds a mysterious, obviously artificial, object buried beneath the Lunar surface and, with the intelligent computer H.A.L. 9000, sets off on a quest.

Saying that ""2001"" is overrated is the sort of statement that can bring down hatred and vitriol from science fiction fans, Kubrick fans and more. Of course, it is possible to be a Kubrick fan and still generally dislike this film.

Nobody can deny that this film is visually stunning, and a landmark in imagery. It also has the advantage of being the last film about space travel to be released before the moon landing, making it somewhat prescient in a way.

But yet, does it need to be so long, so grand, with the music and long shots? Perhaps not quite ""pretentious"", but the film presents itself as being more important than it really is. Critics at the time (1968) denounced the film, and perhaps they were right. At the very least, two cuts could be made: a longer one for die-hard fans, and a shorter one for casual viewers.",6
A Space Odyssey,9,121,"There's a monolith that seeks to influence, the evolution of the simian confluence, teaching apes how to compete, how to kill to get their meat, all leading to, a lunar revolution. On the moon, another block has been discovered, the apes now have the means to open wings and smother, it's to Jupiter they go, what they'll find nobody knows, but it doesn't seem to fill primates with dread. To protect they have a powerful A. I., it misses nothing, and nothing passes by, everything will not be fine, if you rely on an airline, as it watches with satanic, evil eye. At Jupiter, Darwin gets dispatched, down kaleidoscopic, psychedelic hatch, death brings birth and birth brings earth, a giant foetus wants to berth, I'm not sure hominins will make much of a match.

A perpetually engrossing film that offers more conundrums than conclusions, your interpretations uniquely your own, but the scale, cinematography and concepts are truly out of this world.",8
A Space Odyssey,9,108,"I was born in 1968, the year that saw the original release of 2001: A Space Odyssey; of course, I didn't really get into sci-fi cinema until almost a decade later, when that other movie—you know, the one with the droids, blasters and aliens—broke box-office records. Now aged 47, and fully prepared (or so I thought) for a more cerebrally challenging experience than George Lucas's space opera, I've finally caught up with Kubrick's celebrated sci-fi 'masterpiece'. And I haven't been so bored in a long time.

It's not that I need bucket-loads of action and excitement to enjoy a sci-fi movie—I have deep affection for leisurely '70s genre efforts such as Silent Running and Dark Star (both of which clearly owe a debt to 2001)—but Kubrick's film takes pomposity and tedium to a new level. Perhaps if I was stoned, as I imagine many of the film's original fans were when they first saw it, and watching on a cinema screen instead of a TV, I might have been a little more impressed: the visuals are undeniably awe inspiring, the music is grandiose, the psychedelic finale is a trip, and there is much symbolism and narrative ambiguity for intellectuals to chew over, but at two hours and twenty minutes, with very little dialogue and a tortuously slow pace, I struggled to stay awake.

In short: give me a lightsaber battle any day of the week.

4/10, mostly for the surprisingly effective ape-man suits and the highly detailed spacecraft model effects.",4
A Space Odyssey,9,122,"Kubrick has made some great films. He also made this drivel - a space film that moves at a snail's pace and has no plot or meaning. The first third of the film, including the never-ending opening sequence with monkeys, is mind-numbingly boring. The last third, a psychedelic trip across space and time, is fascinating - if one's on drugs. Only the middle part, featuring that funny guy HAL 9000, is somewhat interesting. To the masses who adore this indulgent nonsense about monoliths and star babies, it supposedly reveals great truths about life, the universe, and everything. The real truth is that the emperor is not wearing any clothes.",4
A Space Odyssey,9,116,"This movie is long. Really LONG. And not just because it lasts 2,5h but rather because there not much in it. The few moments where anything happens may in fact be very artistic and full of deep meanings but there are so few of them and they're so far away from one another that it becomes difficult to even remember what they were half through the movie. This could be reduced to 30-40 minutes and would have lost nothing in the logic

But the most irritating thing are the prolonged scenes showing irrelevant thing happening. Like why do I need to watch the entire landing sequence for 5 agonising minutes?? I mean I got it - the ship is landing. No need to try and bore me to death. Then the lunar travel - again - they are travelling over moon. I get it. I got after like 15 seconds. Whot are the other 4 minutes for? Same with the Jupiter travel, same even with the jogging scene - I got, the man was jogging, do I need to watch his full cardio program for 5 minutes?? Jesus..

If you are someone who wanted to watch this because it's on the ""All Time Greats"" list and someone told you it's good - don't bother. It's more interesting to watch the grass grow",3
A Space Odyssey,9,101,"Having decided to watch this movie for the first time after 53 years I feel I have just lost 149 minutes of my life (I know now why I avoided it). Kubrick should have stuck with kicking the hell out of the homeless in subways. I watched this in 4k and the only think clear was the quality of the 4k transfer which was immaculate (hence 2 stars). Now I'm an intelligent guy and have watched hundreds of movies but I have to say this movie is just behind Tenet as to being the most anti-climatic load of tripe I have ever watched, it made absolutely no sense, and please to all the Kubrick sycophants, don't try to convince me otherwise. The section following the ""collision"" with the monolith approaching Jupiter was more painfully boring than the intermission. If you are thinking of watching this movie, my advice is move along your dvd shelf to something more interesting and entertaining.",2
There Will Be Blood,10,105,"People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways.

What it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.

Now is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us.

Now to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.

Why was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.

Paul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.

You should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.",10
There Will Be Blood,10,108,"This is a compelling family drama charting one man's rise and fall as he ruthless exploits oil in the American west.

It's a film in which the oil is a supporting character in itself, and the series of unfortunate deaths and accidents that beleaguer our leading man reminded me of Emile Zola's excellent novel, Germinal. Daniel Day-Lewis gives another assured performance here, living and breathing rather than merely acting his role, and watching his growing feud with the slimy preacher is the stuff of great cinema. All in all a wonderful, epic film, old fashioned in the best possible sense.",9
There Will Be Blood,10,124,"It has been a while since I watched a film where the acting and casting is so damn convincing - I have to start this review by saying that.

The plot is definitely off the beaten track anf the writing very very much a breath of fresh air.

Unfortunately this is a film that can come down to tastes quite a bit when the reviews come round, and although I can't necessarily critique it specifically, there is something about it that I just couldn't get gripped by, and the ending didn't truly satisfy me (though the end scene itself is probably the high point of the movie. Confusing review, I know)

This is not a negative review by any means, but 8-10 are reserved for films that truly get you talking, or have a huge emotional impact in my opinion

As a recommendation, this film is a definite yes. I believe that I am on the side of people who this genre doesn't appeal to much at all, but as a piece of film and a showcase of acting, it is utterly utterly great.",7
There Will Be Blood,10,123,"There's a prospector by the name of Daniel Plainview, a weathered type of soul, after all the things he's been through, now he's come across some oil, underneath Californian soil, and he's planning to extract, withdraw, accrue. He has a son that he acquired after a blow, now where he goes, young H. B. will also go, as he supports his father's hand, acquiring most of the scrub land, with the knowledge of the flow that sits below. But a preacher seeks to meddle, interfere, and Daniel Plainview's disinclined to be so dear, H. B's deafened by a boom, a long lost brother finds a tomb, there's no salvation, when your life's so insincere.

Two of the finest cinematic characters you'll encounter.",8
There Will Be Blood,10,119,"There Will be Blood! What a fine film! In fact I would go as far to say it is one of the best of the last decade. Visually, it is stunning, I loved the skillful cinematography and shots and the scenery was amazing. Jonny Greenwood's music is atmospheric and haunting as well, the script is lyrical, hysterical and sometimes even baffling, the story is excellent and thematically rich and the pace is fine, quite slow but deliberately so.

There Will be Blood is brilliantly directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and the characters are intriguing. In fact to me the character of Daniel Plainview makes the movie. Magnificently portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis, he is quite complex- while monstrous and cold-hearted, because of his love for his adopted son I wouldn't necessarily call him completely evil either. Paul Dano also does a fine job as Eli Sunday.

Overall, a truly fine film and one of the best of the last decade in my view. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10
There Will Be Blood,10,127,"It's about expansion, it's about capitalism, and whatever that caused the demise of the Wild West myth. ""There Will be Blood"" looks, smell, feels like a Western but this is an Anti-Western more than anything 

There's so much to say about this movie but it left me speechless at the end, Daniel Day-Lewis was hypnotic, giving a performance that reminded me of Orson Welles in ""Citizen Kane"", and Humphrey Bogart in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" ... He's definitely one of the greatest actors of his generation, especially in this performance that probably best defines the alienating effect of materialism. The 40's had Charles Foster Kane, the 80's had Gordon Gekko and the 2000's have Daniel Planview.

Indeed, ""There Will be Blood"" is not your typical 'soul corrupted by money and/or power' drama, as I said, it's all about materialism, ending with a pocket filled by gold and a heart made of the same stone you've been working on all your life, it's trusting anything that has a specific color, a specific smell, working on a land to find a greasy black liquid gushing from its womb, and never, never trusting or giving any credit to ""nothingness"" or ""abstraction"".

Daniel Plainview considers these abstractions with the most profound disdain. Nothing is free, nothing comes from nothing, nothing is unsubstantial. If one claims to be your brother, he has to prove it, if one should make a deal with you, he should talk business and not about education ... not because it's personal, not because it has nothing to do with business, BUT because it is NOTHING and nothingness irritates Plainview as if the only thing he could believe on had to be material. The rest is nothing, feelings are nothing, believing is nothing, these so strong and noble words for us, well, Plainview doesn't give a damn about them...

And more than anything, above all these abstractions, there is religion, God is Daniel Plainview's archenemy  this is the ultimate masquerade for him, the cancer that gangrenes the progress, an evil that transforms people into sheep, almost like animals, the biggest hypocrisy of all  Plainview, the capitalist, almost shares the same opinion than Marx who thought religion was people's opium. And because Plainview despises this hypocrisy, he tries to exorcise his hatred by using religion to achieve his plans, exploiting it, like he exploited his adopted son. No feelings, no sentiments, everything should serve a palpable purpose. The end justifies the means.

And ultimately, he gets rich at the end, he's a respected and feared tycoon, as the purest and most implacable illustration of the American dream. But is he happy? no! because power, prosperity, those are still empty words ... he believes in material, in things, in stuff he drinks like the iconic 'milk-shake' metaphor that still resonates in my mind as one of the most memorable hymns to greed and pragmatism. Plainview is greedy, but not evil, evil is still too abstract a word; because it implies the use of one own conscience while Plainview's conscience was dedicated to one goal: getting bigger, possession, expansion, territoriality.

And are we to blame him? Let's not forget the bleak cinematography at the beginning of the film where we could feel, the stink of the oil, the hardness of the rocks and the land as an incontrollable enemy ... let's not forget that Plainview spent half of his life stuck alone into dark holes made of land, stone, metal, oil, and raw matter, so close he could almost feel them, so close it became a part of him ...

""There Will Be Blood"" is the quintessential film about materialism and its alienating power, when all that matters is matter!",10
There Will Be Blood,10,107,"Totally confused, but never fear, I got it.

Performances, cinematography, actors, Daniel Day Lewis, blah blah blah - all great.....BUT.......

......I simply didn't like it.

I won't say any more than that.",5
There Will Be Blood,10,115,"I was looking forward to seeing this when it was released in the cinemas , a story of single minded obsession with some great reviews from Daniel Day Lewis performance . Only problem was when I checked the local listings of the local Odeon cinemas it wasn't being screened . Nor was it being screened at the Edinburgh film house which left me puzzled . I did find out that it screened at the Edinburgh Cameo but had finished its run before I got a chance to see it . I was puzzled that film that received much critical acclaim didn't get a wider release but after seeing it on Sky movies I'm somewhat surprised it got so much acclaim in the first place

There's a term invented by the American film critic David Bordwell called "" intensified continuity "" which in its simplest term is "" MTV style directing "" . Scorsese did this with GOODFELLAS and CASINO , Oliver Stone with all of his 90s work and Francis Ford Coppolla with Dracula . Bordwell does make a point that shot length seems to be increasing in the late noughties compared to the 1990s . Interestingly NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN which came out the same year as this had a similar , long , rather slow , old fashioned feel to it . But at least NO COUNTRY was a plot driven thriller where as THERE WILL BE BLOOD is character driven which means it can be painfully tedious at some points

The cinematography is good and Lewis certainly isn't bad as Plainview , but the problem is in the cinematic storytelling . The film starts with long sequences with no dialogue and these scenes drags on . There's also a problem with trying to figure out what the message is . You could understand if there's a sympathetic Marxist slant on the fundamental flaws of capitalism but then Plainview's nemesis is shown to be a preacher who isn't exactly portrayed in a good light . Moral ambiguity or moral equivalence ? A thinly disguised attack on George W Bush ? I doubt it , more likely it's just an art-house hit that received more praise than it possibly deserved .

There's not much wrong with it per se . As I said it's a film that is shot and framed well with good cinematography and good performances . However for audience members like myself whose main interest in watching cinema is narrative it's a film that I'm in no hurry to rewatch",5
There Will Be Blood,10,128,"I think the last significant movie I saw that featured Daniel Day-Lewis in a significant role was ""Gangs of New York."" I was reminded of that movie somewhat. My reaction to ""Gangs"" was that it was dreadfully dull, although it did have a smattering of action here and there and at least I could see by the end that there was a point to the whole thing. Its high rating notwithstanding, I have to pin ""There Will Be Blood"" with the same dreadfully dull tag. The difference between this and ""Gangs"" is that there was precious little action to be found here, long stretches of nothingness (about ten minutes passes by at the start of the movie with no dialogue at all) and in the end I really couldn't see what the point of this was. Some parts of this movie are well done. The portrayal of the Old West was totally believable, the look at early oil drilling was interesting, the performances from Day-Lewis as silver miner turned oilman Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano as the charismatic preacher Eli Sunday were good and the final confrontation between Plainview and his ""son"" (Russell Harvard) was very emotional. Overall, though, to me the story didn't seem to flow all that well. It just completely failed to capture my attention, and trying to keep focused on a movie that is just plain uninteresting for two and a half hours is excruciating. For whatever reason I also found the musical score by Jonny Greenwood to be at times inappropriate in that it often just didn't seem to fit the mood of what I was seeing on the screen. Clearly I'm in the minority on this, but I just didn't find this to be a good movie at all, and I frankly can't go any higher than a 2/10 for it.",3
There Will Be Blood,10,102,"Do yourself a favor and do not waste your time or money on this film. It was the longest 2 and a half hours that I have spent on a movie in a very long time. The movie is boring and very slow moving. They think they are clever and artsy by not having any dialogue for the first 25 minutes. Then when the dialogue does begin, you wish it was a silent film. The producer of this film should thank his lucky stars for Day-Lewis as he was the only thing to keep one interested and that is still debatable. In addition, like many movies of today, it also takes a bad view on religion and leaves a very bitter taste. This was a classless and tasteless movie and I am disappointed that Day-Lewis was a part of it.",2
